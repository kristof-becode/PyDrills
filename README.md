# PyDrills
### A collection of basic tutorials, drills and challenges related to Python and its main data science packages, Numpy and Pandas.

On my journey to become acquainted with the Python programming language and its most fundamental data science libraries I decided to gather all the earlier drills and challenges I worked on in one place. 

The coding was done with PyCharm IDE and Jupyter Notebooks. The latter has the advantage that you can run small cells of code blocks and that it is more practical for exploration/visualisation of dataframes.

**What is NumPy?**

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

**What is Pandas?**

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source high-level data analysis and manipulation tool in Python. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.
