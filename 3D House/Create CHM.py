This .py code creates a Canopy Height Model by subtracting the Digital Terrain Model from the Digital Surface Model
or : CHM = DSM-DTM. This should give us the height of buildings. Masking DSM files with a polygon gave weird results
at times so I went back to my original approach of working with CHMs
