    "#### A prime number\n",
    "A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers. The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers. In other words, \n",
    "n is prime if n items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item, or if it is not possible to arrange n dots into a rectangular grid that is more than one dot wide and more than one dot high.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, among the numbers 1 through 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers, as there are no other numbers that divide them evenly (without a remainder). 1 is not prime, as it is specifically excluded in the definition. 4 = 2 × 2 and 6 = 2 × 3 are both composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The divisors of a natural number n are the natural numbers that divide n evenly. Every natural number has both 1 and itself as a divisor. If it has any other divisor, it cannot be prime. This idea leads to a different but equivalent definition of the primes: they are the numbers with exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself. Yet another way to express the same thing is that a number n is prime if it is greater than one and if none of the numbers \n",
    "2, 3, …, n−1{\\displaystyle 2,3,\\dots ,n-1} divides n evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 25 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 100) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n",
    "\n",
    "No even number n greater than 2 is prime because any such number can be expressed as the product 2×n/2\n",
    "{\\displaystyle 2\\times n/2}. Therefore, every prime number other than 2 is an odd number, and is called an odd prime. Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. The numbers that end with other digits are all composite: decimal numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even, and decimal numbers that end in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primality of one\n",
    "Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number so they could not consider its primality. A few mathematicians from this time also considered the prime numbers to be a subdivision of the odd numbers, so they also did not consider 2 to be prime. However, Euclid and a majority of the other Greek mathematicians considered 2 as prime. The medieval Islamic mathematicians largely followed the Greeks in viewing 1 as not being a number. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance mathematicians began treating 1 as a number, and some of them included it as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as prime in his correspondence with Leonhard Euler; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be prime. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered 1 to be prime, and lists of primes that included 1 continued to be published as recently as 1956.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unique factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a number as a product of prime numbers is called a prime factorization of the number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}34866&=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 13\\cdot 149\\\\&=2\\cdot 3^{2}\\cdot 13\\cdot 149\\end{aligned}\n",
    "The terms in the product are called prime factors. The same prime factor may occur more than once; this example has two copies of the prime factor \n",
    "3.\n",
    "When a prime occurs multiple times, exponentiation can be used to group together multiple copies of the same prime number: \n",
    "for example, in the second way of writing the product above, 3^2 denotes the square or second power of \n",
    "3.\n"
